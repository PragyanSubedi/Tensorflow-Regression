# Tensorflow Regression examples
Houses Linear Regression methods in TensorFlow.

## In NN example.py

3 input neurons are created for basic math operations.

a is the activation function i.e. sigmoid function.

### Sigmoid function: S(z) = 1/1+e^(-z)  :shipit:

## In linear_regression_example1.py

x_data and y_label are input data with noise.

Linear regression : y = mx +b has been used.
Cost function : (True value - Neurons 's Predicted Value)^2

Optimizer = Gradient Descent
